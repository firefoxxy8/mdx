# MDX

MDX combines the power of [Markdown][md] with the expressivity of [JSX][jsx].
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.
It's JSX in Markdown.

__:heart: Powerful__: MDX makes it effortless to import and render components in your React/JSX-based projects.

__:computer: Component-based__: Use existing JSX components inside your MDX, and import MDX files as plain components.

__:fire: Blazingly blazing fast__: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs during the build stage.

## Why?

Before MDX, some of the benefits of writing Markdown were lost when integrating with JSX.
Implementations were often template string-based which required lots of escaping and other cumbersome syntax.

MDX seeks to make writing with Markdown _and_ JSX simpler while being more expressive.
The possibilities are endless when you combine components (that can even be dynamic or load data) with the simplicity of Markdown for long-form content.

## Try it



```.mdx
# Hello, world!

Here's an example of the [Rebass][] Donut rendered inside an MDX document.
